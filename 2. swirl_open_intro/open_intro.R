# In a very broad sense of the term, a scientist is one who engages 
# in a | systematic method to acquire knowledge. More importantly, 
# a scientist seeks to answer important questions or problems 
# through careful observations and methods. These observations 
# - collected from experiments, censuses, surveys, field notes, 
# etc. - are known as DATA. Statistics is the study of how best 
# to collect, analyze, and draw conclusions from data.
#

# Once a question has been posed, or a problem identified, the 
# next logical step is to attempt to answer the question. 
# Unfortunately, without any additional information, it is very 
# difficult to answer a question, or diagnose a problem. This 
# is where data collection comes into play! Having a set of 
# observations, or data, related to the question will help reveal 
# an answer.

# But how exactly does one collect useful data?

# Remember, when conducting research, a scientist wants to answer a question,
# one that is usually targeted at a specific population. This population does
# not have to be a human population, as in the most common meaning of the word.
# Think of this population as the group of entities - people, animals, cars,
# salaries, etc. - that is to be studied by the scientist.

# Unfortunately, it is often very difficult, if not impossible, to collect
# thorough data from an entire population. Not only can it be very
# time-consuming to do so, it may also be an inefficient use of resources.
# Instead, scientists target a SAMPLE population. This sample population is
# selected in such a way that it is REPRESENTATIVE of the larger population in
# question. In mathematical terms, this sample population is called a subset of
# the target population.

# Let's quickly test your understanding of the term 'representative.' If you
# were interested in studying the health of men living in the U.S., ages 18-25,
# which sample would be more representative of the target population: 
# 1. a sample of 25 men who live in a nearby retirement home
# 2. a sample of 25 men who are students at a local university?

# 1: Men living at the retirement home
# 2: College students

# Now that you have a basic idea of how a scientist collects data, the next
# step is to learn what to do with all of this data. While this raw data does
# contain useful information, this information is usually specific to each
# individual in the sample population. The scientist seeks to discover trends
# and correlations among the subjects in the sample population, so that he or
# she may draw conclusions about the target population as a whole.

# A statistician collects data from a __________ in order to generalize results
# to an entire __________. (Separate the two words in your response with a
# comma.)
